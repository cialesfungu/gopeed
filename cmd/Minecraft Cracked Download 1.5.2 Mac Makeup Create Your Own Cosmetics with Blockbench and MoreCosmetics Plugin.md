Select 1.5.2 and click Play.

## Tips and Tricks for Minecraft 1.5.2
 
Minecraft 1.5.2 has some features and mechanics that are different from the newer versions of the game. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you make the most of your gameplay experience.
 
- Use carpets to decorate your floors and walls. Carpets are thin blocks that can be placed on top of any solid block. They come in 16 different colors and can be crafted with two wool blocks of the same color. You can also place them on fences or walls to create curtains or banners.
- Use coal blocks to store and smelt large amounts of coal. Coal blocks are crafted with nine coal pieces and can be used as fuel for furnaces, minecarts with furnace, or fire charges. One coal block can smelt 80 items, which is more efficient than using individual coal pieces.
- Use stained clay to build colorful structures. Stained clay is a hardened clay block that can be dyed with any of the 16 colors of dye. It has a smoother texture than wool and does not burn in fire or lava. You can craft stained clay with eight hardened clay blocks and one dye in the center.
- Use horses to travel faster and jump higher. Horses are a new mob that spawn in plains and savanna biomes. They can be tamed by repeatedly riding them until they stop bucking you off. You can then equip them with a saddle and a horse armor to ride them and protect them from damage. Horses have different speeds, health, and jump heights depending on their breed and color.
